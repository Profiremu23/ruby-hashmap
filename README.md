# ruby-hashmap
My implementation of a [hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) using Ruby as part of my [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) journey (TOP)

This project demonstrates Ruby's ability of emulating a hash map (or hash table) by recreating the various required methods using Ruby's vanilla methods. The HashMap class uses another custom class made by me, [the LinkedList class](https://github.com/Profiremu23/ruby-linked-lists) alongside the vanilla methods provided by Ruby itself. The main.rb program can be modified to run different sets of instructions to execute to the user's terminal.

## How do you run it?
In order to run this wonderful piece of software, you need to open your Git/Linux/MacOS terminal and navigate into ../ruby-hashmap. then run ruby main.rb to see the results.
